# hello-world
The hello-world repository was created to gain a basic introductory understanding of some of the GitHub capabilities.

My name is James Chisholm and I am a recent undergraduate with a Bachelor of Science in Software Development. I love leaerning and I am practicing on GitHub in order to have a repository to place my programs. I am currently spending a large portion of my free time to learn about GitHub, software design patterns, and further my knowledge in the C# programming language.
